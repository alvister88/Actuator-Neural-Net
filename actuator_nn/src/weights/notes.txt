GRU:
- model29 --> current best model, generalizes the best to test, doesn't capture small details, not much torque ripple
- model30 --> does not generalize as well, can capture torque ripple quite well
- model 31 and 32 --> best models now, both very good (also super similar)
- model 34 (history size 26, 4 layers) generalizes best to test data, might fit a bit worse for torque ripple
- model 36 generalizes well, but takes in larger history making it slower; not worth it
- model 37 generalizes well and model torque ripple well
